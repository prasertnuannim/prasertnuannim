    "title": "About Me",
    "description1": "Hi, I'm Prasert Nuannim\n\nI'm a web developer specializing in building high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using the full capabilities of Next.js — including SSR, SSG, dynamic routing, API routes, middleware, and SEO optimization.\n\nI'm proficient in TypeScript for type-safe development, Redux for managing complex application state, and Tailwind CSS for crafting fast and responsive user interfaces.\n\nI also have hands-on experience connecting with both SQL databases (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL), and using Node.js to build robust backend services and APIs.",
    "description2": "My journey in tech began with over 10 years of experience in IT Support, where I developed strong skills in system management, technical troubleshooting, and systems thinking.\n\nThis experience shaped the way I approach software development — with a deep understanding of backend systems, paired with a focus on intuitive and scalable user experiences.\n\nAlong the way, I’ve had the opportunity to work on web projects involving IoT and AI image processing, allowing me to bridge the gap between hardware integration, data handling, and building interactive front-end applications."

    "descriptionOEE": "Developed a web application to display real-time OEE dashboard metrics for IoT systems, including run hours, loss hours, output, and summarized losses. Built interactive dashboards using React (TSX), Chart.js, Material UI, and Redux.\nImplemented a Node.js backend and established a connection to a MySQL server. Leveraged stored procedures in MySQL to optimize complex data queries for OEE metrics.",
    "descriptionMonitorMachine": "Developed a full-stack web application for updating machine data and tracking real-time machine status, integrating IoT monitoring using Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, NextAuth, and NextUI on the frontend, with a Node.js backend connected to a MySQL server. The system allows authorized users to sign in and modify machine states or related data, while admins can manage user accounts—including creating, editing, deleting, assigning permissions, and resetting passwords—through a centralized user table. Regular users are granted access to update machine information according to their roles and permissions.",
    "descriptionESD": "Developed an Anti-Static ESD Access Control Tester system designed to work with legacy hardware, using a microcontroller to monitor employee status, control door access, and store logs in a MySQL database. The frontend was built with Next.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and NextAuth, while the backend was developed with Node.js. Raspberry Pi runs a Python script to communicate with the ESD testing apparatus. The system includes a data grid for managing employee data (add, edit, delete, display), and an ESD tester display that prompts users to enter their employee ID, verifies access permissions to the production line, and counts signal points to validate results from the ESD machine before sending responses to the BD system."

    "descriptionBelton": "I began working at Belton Co., Ltd. in 2013 - 2024 as an IT Support specialist, where I was responsible for installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting office and production computer systems, including resolving network issues related to Cisco infrastructure. Over the course of more than a decade, I expanded my skill set and transitioned into web and IoT development. I designed and deployed an internal Wi-Fi network and API domain to support IoT projects, utilized MySQL for calculating Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) while preserving raw machine data, and developed microcontroller solutions using Python and Arduino (C/C++) for real-time equipment control and data collection. I also created internal dashboards and web applications using technologies such as Node.js, Next.js, React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js to visualize IoT data and support data-driven decisions in the production environment.",
    "descriptionGeno": "Developed full-stack web applications using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with PostgreSQL as the primary database. Integrated the system with IoT devices to send and receive data from controllers, and visualized real-time data through dashboards. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver efficient and scalable solutions."
