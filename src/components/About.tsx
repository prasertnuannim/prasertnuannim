        <p className='text-lg'>Hi, I’m Prasert Nuannim — a passionate software developer with a strong interest in modern web technologies, IoT, and AI. I specialize in building intuitive, scalable digital solutions using frameworks like Next.js and React, along with tools such as Tailwind CSS and Node.js.

          My journey began with over 10 years of experience in IT Support, where I managed and maintained system operations with efficiency and reliability. This solid technical foundation has helped shape my developer mindset — combining problem-solving, system thinking, and user-focused design.

          I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and tackling new challenges that push the boundaries of what technology can do. Let’s connect!</p>
